## Objective
When you install or reinstall a Windows operating system, you are given an admin access password. We strongly recommend that you change it, as detailed in our guide to [securing a Dedicated Server](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/dedicated/securing-a-dedicated-server/). You may also find that you have lost this password, and need to change it.

**This guide will take you through the process of changing your server's admin password.**

## Requirements

* a [Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/){.external} with Windows installed
* access to the [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}

## Instructions

First, boot your server into [rescue mode](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/dedicated/rescue_mode/){.external} using the WinRescue boot environment. Once the server has rebooted, select the `IPMI`{.action} tab on your server's page in your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}.

Next, activate the IPMI feature using either the Java applet or your browser. After the IPMI session has started, double-click the NTPWdi server tool on the WindRescue desktop.
