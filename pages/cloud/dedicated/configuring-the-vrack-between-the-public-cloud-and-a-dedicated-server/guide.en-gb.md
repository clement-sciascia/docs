## Objective

The [vRack](https://www.ovh.co.uk/solutions/vrack/){.external} allows you to configure private network addressing between two or more OVH [Dedicated Servers](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/){.external}. But it also allows you to add [Public Cloud instances](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/instances/){.external} to your private network so that you can create an infrastructure of both physical and virtual resources.

**This guide will show you how to configure private networking between a [Public Cloud instance](https://www.ovh.co.uk/public-cloud/instances/){.external} and a [Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/){.external}.**


## Requirements

* a [vRack](https://www.ovh.co.uk/solutions/vrack/){.external} service activated in your account
* a vRack-compatible [Dedicated Server](https://www.ovh.co.uk/dedicated_servers/){.external}
* access to your [OVH Control Panel](https://www.ovh.com/auth/?action=gotomanager){.external}
* your chosen private IP address range
