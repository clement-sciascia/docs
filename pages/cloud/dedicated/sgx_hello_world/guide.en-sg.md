## Objective

Enable Intel Software Guard Extensions on your server, to be able to run SGX-ready applications  
Intel SGX delivers advanced hardware and RAM security encryption features, in order to isolate parts of code and data that are specific to each application

## Requirements

- An [infrastructure dedicated server](https://www.ovh.com/sg/dedicated-servers/infra/){.external}, with the [SGX](https://www.ovh.com/sg/dedicated-servers/software-guard-extensions/){.external} option
- Administrative (root) access to the server via SSH
- Access to the [OVH API](https://ca.api.ovh.com/console/){.external}
- Ubuntu 18.04 or similar installed on the server

## Instructions

### Step 1 - Log into the API console

Go to <https://api.ovh.com/console/> and click the `Login`{.action} in the top-right corner of the page.  
On the following page, log in with the credentials of your OVH account.

### Step 2 - Enable SGX

Get the name of your server from the list returned from this call :

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server

Verify that your service has the SGX option, by calling : 

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx

![SGX disabled](images/get-disabled.png){.thumbnail}

Next, let's enable SGX :

> [!api]
>
> @api {POST} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx/configure

![Configure SGX](images/post-configure.png){.thumbnail}

Check the progress of the configuration task by calling this endpoint with the taskId returned by the previous call :

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/task/{taskId}

![Get SGX configuration task](images/get-task.png){.thumbnail}

You can verify that the status is now enabled :

> [!api]
>
> @api {GET} /dedicated/server/{serviceName}/biosSettings/sgx

![SGX enabled](images/get-enabled.png){.thumbnail}

### Step 3 - Reboot to apply the new BIOS settings

### Step 4 - Install the SGX software stack

Now we will install Intel's driver and SDK to be able to develop and run SGX applications.  

First, let's install some dependencies :
```bash
apt-get install build-essential ocaml ocamlbuild automake autoconf libtool wget python libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev debhelper cmake
```

Then, download, build and install the SGX software stack :
```bash
BASE_DIR=/opt/intel
[[ -d $BASE_DIR ]] || sudo mkdir -p $BASE_DIR && sudo chown `whoami` $BASE_DIR
cd $BASE_DIR

git clone https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx.git

cd linux-sgx
git checkout sgx_2.6
./download_prebuilt.sh
make -j 6
make sdk_install_pkg -j 6
make deb_pkg -j 6
$BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/bin/sgx_linux_x64_sdk_2.6.100.51363.bin --prefix=$BASE_DIR/

sudo dpkg -i $BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/deb/libsgx-urts_2.6.100.51363-bionic1_amd64.deb $BASE_DIR/linux-sgx/linux/installer/deb/libsgx-enclave-common_2.6.100.51363-bionic1_amd64.deb
```

Download and install the driver :
```bash
wget https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/linux-2.6/ubuntu18.04-server/sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
chmod +x sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
sudo ./sgx_linux_x64_driver_2.5.0_2605efa.bin
```

### Step 5 - Reboot to finish the installation

### Step 6 - Use a sample application to validate the installation

Build one of the sample apps provided :
```bash
BASE_DIR=/opt/intel
cd $BASE_DIR/sgxsdk/SampleCode/LocalAttestation/
source $BASE_DIR/sgxsdk/environment
make SGX_DEBUG=0 SGX_MODE=HW SGX_PRERELEASE=1
```

Run it :
```bash
ovh@nsXXXX:/opt/intel/sgxsdk/SampleCode/LocalAttestation$ ./app
